# Hi, I'm Mrudhuhas

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with over 7 years of experience building and deploying AI solutions. My focus lies in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and Generative AI. I work across the stack ‚Äî from training transformer architectures like BERT and GPT-2 to deploying scalable microservices on the cloud using Docker, Kubernetes, and FastAPI.

In recent years, I've been deeply involved in projects that combine deep learning with practical applications ‚Äî building tools, deploying models, and continuously learning from the evolving AI ecosystem.
