# üëã Hi, I am Mrudhuhas

Machine learning engineer with 7+ years of experience in building and deploying models, specializing in natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), and generative AI (GenAI). I have worked extensively with modern architectures such as transformers (BERT, GPT-2) and transfer learning. My expertise includes deploying models on cloud platforms like AWS, with hands-on experience using Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI, and microservice architectures. Additionally, I am familiar with web technologies, making me versatile in AI-driven solutions.
